# Wethinkcode
My wethinkcode repository

week 0:
Week 0 was simple enough, no real challange during the assignments and nothing i couldnt understand

week 1:
week one again was pretty simple for me to understand, though i had problems with meal.py, you'll be able to see the changes and what i needed to add and fix to that file. My usse of github has improved and I can now use it somewhat easily, though I am still confused aboyt branches, I understand what they're for, but how to use them is a whole different ball game.
