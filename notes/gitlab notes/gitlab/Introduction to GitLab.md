GitLab is a ****git-based completely integrated DevSecOps platform for the complete software development lifecycle****.![[Pasted image 20250723120835.png]]
**The SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is complex**. And as your organization's SDLC matures, **your toolchain complexity increases**
Historically, as needs evolve, organizations will identify **one preferred tool for each function** leading to **a system of disparate tools**, held together with **"digital duct tape"** and **manual processes** **Which often lead to:**
- Redundant and incompatible tools   
- Data and process silos
- No alignment among teams
- No consistent application security or compliance
- No consistent traceability
- A high degree of context switching

For example, when approaching a software project, **Developers need to consider tools for**:  
- Project planning
- Source Code Management
- Continuous Integration
- Infrastructure configuration
- Incident Monitoring
- Application Security
- Compliance Assurance
To that end, GitLab **fundamentally changes the way that organizations approach DevSecOps**, offering a **Single DevSecOps Platform** in which **a single application** with **a logical set of DevSecOps capabilities**

GitLab's goal is to empower **all of your Teams** - Software, Operations, IT, Security, and Business - to collaboratively plan, build, secure, deploy and monitor software across an end-to-end unified system.

**Who is using GitLab?**
	 **Product Manager/Designers**
	 **Developers**
	 **Security Teams**
	 **Operations Teams**
	 **Compliance Managers**

**How can they use GitLab?**
	- Product Managers can use the GitLab Planning features for team planning, portfolio management, requirements management, quality management, and design management. They can also output DORA metrics, DevOps reports, and leverage the GitLab Wiki and Pages for documentation.
	- Developers can use the GitLab Create and Verify features for source code management, code review workflow, and remote development, as well as continuous integration (CI) and code testing and coverage
	- Security Teams can use the GitLab Package and Secure features to maintain a package and container registry and to enforce security and compliance policies consistently across application development. They also have full oversight on the security posture of a project or group of projects and can triage and manage vulnerabilities.
	- Operations Teams can use the GitLab Monitoring features for incident management, environment management, deployment management, and feature flags.
	- Compliance Managers can use the GitLab Compliance Features for dependency, vulnerability, and compliance management.
